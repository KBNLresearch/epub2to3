## About

Experimental EPUB 2 to EPUB 3 conversion workflow.

## DAISY pipeline setup (Linux)

Workflow raps around [DAISY pipeline](https://github.com/daisy/pipeline). To make it work, first:

1. Install DAISY pipeline from <https://daisy.github.io/pipeline/Download.html>.
2. Install CLI tool from <https://github.com/daisy/pipeline-cli-go/releases>

Then check the status of the DAISY pipeline server (should start up automatically):

```
service daisy-pipeline2 status
```
